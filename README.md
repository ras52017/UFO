# UFO

##Overview of the Analysis

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. 

##Results

To use this site, one will have to activate the website and type in the parameters to filter by and then click outside the filter boxes. This will then filter to the selected parameters. To reset, one can refresh the page.

##Summary: 

In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

1.	The drawback of this new design is that there is no filter button to help filter the parameters.

2.	It will also be good to have a reset botton as well so that filtered parameters can be reste to the baseline design
